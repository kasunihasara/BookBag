                <p className="book-paragraph">In The Book of Soul, Mark Nepo, the bestselling author of The Book 
                    of Awakening, offers a powerful guide to inhabiting an authentic and 
                    wholehearted life. After we are physically born, we must be spiritually 
                    born a second time, a process that takes place through the labor of a 
                    lifetime as we develop into more fully realized beings. The Book of Soul 
                    delves into the spiritual alchemy of that transformation in all its mystery, 
                    difficulty, and inevitability.

                    The book is divided into four sections that mark the passages we all face: 
                    enduring our Walk in the World</p>
